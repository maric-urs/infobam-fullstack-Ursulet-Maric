# Infobam Technical Test

_Read this in [French 🇫🇷](./README-FR.md)_

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the Repository (Mandatory)**
   - Fork this repository to your GitHub account before starting
   - All work must be done in your forked repository
   - Make sure your repository remains public until the evaluation
   - Create feature branches for each component or functionality
   - Submit your work through Pull Requests

## Context

This technical test simulates a real-world development environment where you'll be working as part of a team of 5 developers. We expect you to follow standard team development practices including proper git workflow, clear documentation, and maintainable code. Your work should reflect how you would contribute to a shared codebase.

## Objective

Create a vehicle showcase application using Next.js and a backend of your choice (NestJS or Next.js API Routes). The application should display a list of vehicles with filtering and sorting capabilities.

You can either:

- Use the provided mock data
- Implement your own backend with the provided data structure

## Required Features

- Responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Display a paginated vehicle list
- Filter vehicles by manufacturer, type, and year
- Sort vehicles by price and year
- Display detailed vehicle information
- Implement proper git workflow (feature branches, clear commits, PRs)

## Data Structure

```typescript
interface Vehicle {
  id: string;
  manufacturer: string; // e.g., "BMW", "Tesla", "Toyota"
  model: string; // e.g., "X5", "Model 3", "Camry"
  year: number;
  type: VehicleType;
  price: number;
  fuelType: string;
  transmission: string;
  mileage?: number;
  features: string[];
  images: string[];
  description: string;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}

enum VehicleType {
  SUV = "SUV",
  SEDAN = "SEDAN",
  TRUCK = "TRUCK",
  SPORTS = "SPORTS",
  LUXURY = "LUXURY",
  ELECTRIC = "ELECTRIC",
}

enum FuelType {
  GASOLINE = "GASOLINE",
  DIESEL = "DIESEL",
  ELECTRIC = "ELECTRIC",
  HYBRID = "HYBRID",
  PLUGIN_HYBRID = "PLUGIN_HYBRID",
}
```

## Evaluation Criteria

### Technical Presentation (50%)

The most important part of the evaluation will be a video call where you'll present:

- Your technical choices and their justification
- Architecture decisions
- Code organization
- Challenges encountered and solutions
- Potential improvements and scalability
- Live demonstration of the application

### Code Quality (30%)

- Clean and maintainable code
- TypeScript usage
- Component organization
- Error handling
- Testing approach
- Responsive design implementation

### Development Practices (20%)

- Git workflow
- Documentation
- Code organization
- Commit clarity

## Timeline

- Expected time: 4-6 hours
- Technical presentation: 20 minutes + 10 minutes Q&A

## Presentation Guidelines

Prepare to discuss:

1. Technical stack choices
2. Architecture decisions
3. State management approach
4. Data fetching strategy
5. Performance considerations
6. Testing strategy
7. Potential improvements
8. Scalability considerations

## Development Requirements

### Git Workflow

1. Fork the repository (mandatory)
2. Create feature branches for each component
3. Make atomic commits with clear messages
4. Submit work through Pull Requests
5. Document major decisions in PR descriptions

### Code Organization

1. Follow Clean Architecture principles
2. Implement proper TypeScript types/interfaces
3. Create reusable components
4. Include unit tests for core functionality
5. Document API endpoints and components

Good luck! 🚀
